title = KV2-117A Control Rotor
manufacturer = Kerbal Standard
description = In the competition for Control Rotors, the KV2-117A is unmatched. Though, it features 3 blades, they are quite huge and powerful. It's bigger than your usual set of Control Rotors. Of course, it results to a better control, as well as more weight. But the power-to-weight losses should be minimal.
