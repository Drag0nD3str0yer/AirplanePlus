	- I added two more engines to the pack. It's in the imgur album if you want to see for yourself. I also teamed up with a forum member which you could check out on the forum thread. You'll find his name in the information panel as well. He pretty much did all the performance configuration which was a massive help to me. The performance should feel way better than before.
